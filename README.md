## 🎵 Audio Features

The game doesnt include a music player because the developer decided to toss it at a wall messing the whole thing up! 
Jokes aside I will add this back later:
- ~~**Lumbridge Theme** - Peaceful town music that could play in background~~
- ~~**Varrock Theme** - Busy autmosphere that is similiar to the original~~
- ~~**Wilderness Theme** - Dangerous area music~~
- ~~**Magic Tower Theme** - Arcane ambiance~~
- ~~**Combat Sounds** - Attack and battle effects~~

## 🔧 Development

This project demonstrates advanced Windows batch scripting techniques:
- Complex game logic in batch files
- File-based save systems
- ASCII art and text-based graphics
- Modular code structure
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations (will need to move away from strict batch, will keep the ASCII feel to it)
